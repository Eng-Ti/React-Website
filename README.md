2. The significant features of React include;

i. JSX
JSX is an abbreviation of JavaScript XML  a syntax extension for JavaScript. It is an XML or HTML like syntax used by ReactJS. This syntax is converted into React Framework JavaScript calls. It enhances ES6 to allow HTML-like text and JavaScript react code to coexist. Even though it is not required to utilize JSX, it is strongly recommended in ReactJS

ii. Components
A ReactJS application consists of several components, each with its own logic and controls i.e every application built in react is made up of pieces of components. These components are reusable, which makes it easier to keep track of the code when working on larger projects.

iii. One-way Data Binding
ReactJS is built to follow unidirectional data flow, often known as one-way data binding. The advantages of one-way data binding provide you more control over the application as a whole. 

iv. Virtual DOM
The original DOM object is represented by a virtual DOM object. It functions similarly to a one-way data binding. The complete UI is re-rendered in virtual DOM representation whenever any changes are made to the web application. Then it compares the old DOM representation to the new DOM representation. After that, the true DOM will only update the elements that have actually changed. This speeds up the application and eliminates memory waste.

v. Performance
ReactJS is well-known for its performance. This is due to the fact that it controls a virtual DOM. Virtual components are converted into the DOM  which results into smoother and faster performances.

3. The advantages of React are:
i. Effortless maintanance - React JS has a  modular and flexible architecture which leads to modernizing  component independently without affecting others. As a result, less time is consumed in modernization, code is maintained, and all this is performed economically.

ii. Fast Rendering - React JS React JS comprises of in-built functionality of virtual DOM, which makes the rendering faster and enhances overall user experience.

iii. Search Engine Friendly -the virtual DOM feature of ReactJS renders the application more accurately and returns web apps as  typical web pages, as such  search bots are able to crawl through the React JS website and effortlessly analyze the relevance and rank the particular website on the search engine.

iv. Ract JS offers Mobile Application Development.

v. Component Reusability - components making up React applications can bereused sevaral times which reduces effort and minimizes timelines.

5. Notable differences between HTML & JSX

i. In HTML, multiple elements can be returned while nested JSX can only return one elements, to return all nested items;  a parent element wrappping all other levels of nested elements needs to be called.

ii. HTML elements have attributes while JSX elements have props.

iii. The class attribute can be used on any HTML element while you can’t use the word class to define HTML classes in JSX, since class is a reserved word in JavaScript, instead, use — className.

6. Browswers can't read JSX because browsers can only read JavaScript objects and JSX in not a regular JavaScript object.
